Repository for music generation application
The model used for generation is a score based generative model, trained on several music stored in folder /data
The idea is to be able to generate a composer-like music on a website.
The repowitory handles the modelisation, training etc... of this deep learning model
and the deployment with a python flask api (app.py).
